title: Computational Modeling and Analysis
summary: |
    *Connecting molecular behavior and macroscopic measurements.*

    We use computational methods to predict and interpret relaxometry and other measurements done using single-sided magnets. We also actively pursue better methods to analyze relaxometry data in context of particular applications.
