Tyler Meldrum is an associate professor of chemistry at William & Mary and the PI of the spinlab. His research combines nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, physical chemistry, and student-driven projects to study materials, molecules, and new scientific frontiers.  

Outside of research and teaching, Tyler is a coffee enthusiast (black in the mornings, an oat milk cortado in the afternoons), science communicator, and a proud dad. When not wrangling experiments, you can find him exploring the intersection of data, design, and educationâ€”with a little bit of sass and a lot of curiosity.
