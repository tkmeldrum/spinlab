Thomas Felton is originally from Gainesville, Virginia. He is interested in Baseball, Data Analysis, and travel/exploration. He's trying to create as many experiences as he can while he still has the time. When he's not working/studying, he's either playing club baseball or meandering (physically and/or mentally). He likes to keep his friends close and his food closer.
